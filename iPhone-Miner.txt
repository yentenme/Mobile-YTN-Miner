How to mine Yenten in 32 bits on an iPhone.

Install iSH (through testlight): https://ish.app

apk add git #if you want to grab code from github
apk add openssh # alternative I use at home to copy the code using scp in dev mode
apk add python python-dev 
apk add gcc bash
apk add musl-dev



git clone ... or copy code
cd <dir>
chmod +x buildme.sh
./buildme.sh

./go.sh

just edit ni.sh and ni2.sh to change YTN miner address.

There is a lot of hardcoding, but it works.

NOTE: This was able to mine above 1.5 H/s on iPhone7 ice-cooled (otherwise, it can fall below 0.5 H/s). Yes, your phone will overheat.

NOTE: The way this code works is totally inefficient on a PC. But for some reason, the usage of TCP between python and C is faster than actual compiled python module calls on iSH.
